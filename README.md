## Visual Studio Blue UI theme for atom

This is an atom theme inspired by the Blue theme of Visual Studio.

For Visual Studio Syntax experience use the [Redmond Syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/redmond-syntax) made by [nycdotnet](https://atom.io/users/nycdotnet).

### Adaptive

To some extend this theme uses colors of the syntax theme, although it is not intended to be fully adaptive.

Here it is with the solaris light syntax theme:

### Settings

In the theme settings you can change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down.

Switch between 3 __Layout Modes__:

1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.
2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.
3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.

And pick a __Tab Sizing__ mode:

1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode the tabs switch based on the window size.
2. `Minimum` - In Mimimum mode the tabs will be as small as possible.
3. `Even` - In Even mode all tabs will be the same size.
